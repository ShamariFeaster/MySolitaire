My version of Klondike is an application. It allows the user to cycle through 
the waste deck as many times as they want. To move cards from one place to another 
on the board, assuming it's a valid move, you click on the card you want to move 
and drag the card to where you want to put it. If the card doesn't go you will
see a message appear int he status bar on the bottom right of the interface 
telling you the move is invalid.

The scoring is described in the rules section shown when you press the "Show rules" 
button on the bottom left of the interface.

To star a new game press the "New Game" button.
